# Mixed-Effect Model for Brain-Genetic Trajectories

This repository contains an R-based analysis for studying mixed-effect models applied to brain-genetic trajectories. It includes R scripts for data analysis, the required data files, and results generated from the models.

## Directory Structure

- **Rscripts/**  
  This directory contains all R scripts used for data analysis and modeling.

- **data/**  
  Contains the datasets required for analysis. The data files can be loaded by using relative paths with the `here` package.

- **results/**  
  This directory stores the output of the analysis, including model summaries, figures, and tables.

- **.Rproj**  
  The R project file (`Analisi.Rproj`) which can be opened directly in RStudio to set up the project environment.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the R project and run the scripts for analysis:
